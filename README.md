# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of the project

### Purpose
This project aims to help a biological researcher, Roza, to set up a webpage, which she and her co-workers could access to obtain the data they wants. Roza is working on bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. And she had a hypothesis that the ideal bacterial species may be found from human’s navel, so Roza took samples from volunteers across the country. Now she asked us to put all information online and create a dropdown menu including all volunteers’ ID number. Therefore, both her research participants, and fellow researchers can find specific volunteer demographic information. To make the result easier to read, we visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer. In this way, if the best bacterial species to manufacture synthetic beef are found in the future, people could quickly identify whether that species is found in volunteer’s navel.
